**Overview**
A bank loan is when a bank offer to lend money to customers for a certain time period.
As a condition of the bank, the borrower will need to pay a certain amount of interest per month, or per year.
The bank will provide a loan for different purpose like business loan, home loan, education loan etc. One of the most challenging part of a bank is whether the customers will pay back with interest or not because most of the bank comes for a interest. To overcome this problem, we are using machine learning model which help us to predict accurately whether customers are defaulter or not
